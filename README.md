## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Contestly fetches comprehensive contest data from various platforms using the [clist.by API](https://clist.by/). This data can be periodically retrieved (potentially via a backend service like AWS Lambda) and stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The Flutter application then interacts with Supabase to display contest information, manage user profiles, authentication, and preferences. User-specific statistics are fetched directly from platform APIs like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Flutter SDK: Ensure Flutter is installed. Refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
*   A Supabase account: For setting up the backend database and authentication. Get started at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
*   API keys/credentials for:
    *   `clist.by` (if used for fetching data)
    *   Google Cloud Platform (for Google Sign-In, Google Calendar API).
    *   Firebase project setup (for Crashlytics, Performance, and other Firebase services).

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhanesh-Sawant/contestly.git
    cd contestly
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase URL, Supabase anon key, Google Server Client ID, and any other required API keys.
Example `.env` file:
```env
supabaseUrl=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
anonKey=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
serverClientId=YOUR_GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID_FOR_SIGN_IN
# Add other API keys if necessary
```

### Set up Firebase
Ensure you have a Firebase project set up and the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file is correctly configured for your Android (and iOS if applicable) app. This is typically done using the FlutterFire CLI.

### Run the application
```bash
flutter run
```
